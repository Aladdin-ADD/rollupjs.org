	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	<p>Rollup is a next-generation JavaScript module bundler. Author your app or library in ES2015 modules, distribute as browser and Node.js friendly packages.</p>

	<h2>So it's like Browserify or Webpack?</h2>
	<p>Yes, except that the resulting bundle is smaller, because ES2015 modules are more efficient than CommonJS, and make it possible to eliminate wasted bytes with <em>tree-shaking</em>.</p>

	<h2>Tree-shaking?</h2>
	<p>Normally if you <code>require</code> a module, you import the whole thing. ES2015 lets you just import the bits you need, without mucking around with custom builds. It's a revolution in how we use libraries in JavaScript, and it's happening right now.</p>

	<h2>Sounds great! How do I get started?</h2>
