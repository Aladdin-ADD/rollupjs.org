title: Creating your first bundle
---

*Before we begin, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed so that you can use [npm](https://npmjs.com). You'll also need to know how to access the [command line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line) on your machine.*

The easiest way to use Rollup is via the Command Line Interface (or CLI). For now, we'll install it globally (later on we'll learn how to install it locally to your project so that your build process is portable, but don't worry about that yet). Type this into the command line:

```bash
npm install rollup --global # or `npm i rollup -g` for short
```

You can now run the `rollup` command. Try it!

```bash
rollup
```

Because no arguments were passed, Rollup prints usage instructions. This is the same as running `rollup --help`, or `rollup -h`.

Let's create a simple project:

```bash
mkdir -p my-rollup-project/src
cd my-rollup-project
```

First, we need an *entry point*. Paste this into a new file called `src/main.js`:

```js
// src/main.js
import foo from './foo.js';
export default function () {
  console.log(foo);
}
```

Then, let's create the `foo.js` module that our entry point imports:

```js
// src/foo.js
export default 42;
```

Now we're ready to create a bundle:

```bash
rollup src/main.js --format cjs
```

The `--format` option specifies what kind of bundle we're creating â€” in this case, CommonJS (which will run in Node.js). Because we didn't specify an output file, it will be printed straight to `stdout`:

```js
'use strict';

var foo = 42;

var main = function () {
  console.log(foo);
};

module.exports = main;
```

You can save the bundle as a file like so:

```bash
rollup src/main.js --format cjs --output bundle.js
# or `rollup main.js -f cjs -o bundle.js`
```

(You could also do `rollup src/main.js > bundle.js`, but as we'll see later, this is less flexible if you're generating sourcemaps.)

Try running the code:

```bash
node
> var myBundle = require('./bundle.js');
> myBundle();
42
```

Congratulations! You've created your first bundle with Rollup.
